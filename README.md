## Notes and to-do items:

- ~~check whether the event system counts pasting 20 characters as 1 input or 20.~~
- ~~refresh on exact requirements.txt (etc.) naming conventions~~
- read in a config via CL arg to import local file specifying configs (e.g. window size, min, max, etc.)
- be sure to test this as part of (ideally monolithic) compiled applications for Linux and Windows
