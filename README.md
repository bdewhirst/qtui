## minimal instructions to create environment:
- python 3.10.14
- requirements as specified in `requirements.pip.txt`


----
## Notes and to-do items:

- ~~check whether the event system counts pasting 20 characters as 1 input or 20.~~
- ~~refresh on exact requirements.txt (etc.) naming conventions~~
- In a more fully-featured way, expanding on `protos/parserDemoApp.py`, directly leverage the config file as part of app (e.g. app name, version number, window size, min, max, etc.)
- be sure to test this as part of (ideally monolithic) compiled applications for Linux and Windows
